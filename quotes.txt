Responsive is better than fast
It's not fully shipped until it's fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
The purpose of our lives is to be happy
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game
Money and success donâ€™t change people; they merely amplify what is already there
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor
